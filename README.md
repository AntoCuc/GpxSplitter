Gpx Splitter
============

Split GPX files too large to fit in GPS handheld devices into multiple files that do.

This software is meant to be used to generate files to be used on Handheld GPS devices used for hicking, trakking and mountain/road biking.
GPS handheld devices have historically had limited features so to minimise power consumption as they are powered with consumer grade cells.
Some of the more recent GPS devices have better-performing built-in rechargeable cells. However, their feature sets are still limited.

Why split Gpx files
-------------------

In 2011 I purchased a Garmin Etrex Legend for my Sunday road bike training and to load Audax routes.
As the milage went up the amount of waypoints in the routes also grew.
The eTrex Legend has a limit of 125 waypoints for GPX route files so soon I needed to start "splitting" Gpx files.
