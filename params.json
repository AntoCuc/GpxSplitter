  "body": "# GpxSplitter #\r\n\r\nSplit GPX files too large to fit in GPS handheld devices into multiple files \r\nthat do.\r\n\r\nGpxSplitter is meant to be used to generate files to be imported on Handheld \r\nGPS devices used for hicking, trekking and mountain/road biking.\r\n\r\nGPS handheld devices have historically had limited features to minimise power \r\nconsumption as some are powered with consumer-grade cells.\r\nMore recent GPS devices have better-performing built-in rechargeable cells. \r\nHowever, feature sets are still limited.\r\n\r\n## Why split Gpx files ##\r\n\r\nIn 2011 I purchased a Garmin Etrex Legend for road bike training and to load \r\nAudax routes.\r\nAs the milage I could ride went up the amount of waypoints in the routes also \r\ngrew.\r\nThe eTrex Legend has a limit of 125 waypoints per route file so I needed to \r\nstart \"splitting\" Gpx files too long to be imported.\r\nThat is when development of GpxSplitter started.\r\n\r\n## Downloads ##\r\n\r\nDownloadable artefacts for all platforms are published as [GpxSplitter Github releases](https://github.com/AntoCuc/GpxSplitter/releases).\r\n\r\n## Building from source ##\r\n\r\nIf you are not particularly interested in building GpxSplitter yourself\r\ndownload one of the executables and jump to \"Running the software\".\r\n\r\n### Dependencies ###\r\n\r\nTo clone GpxSplitter from Github:\r\n - git 2.7.0 or greater\r\n\r\nTo build the source code:\r\n - Oracle JDK 8 or greater\r\n - Apache Maven 3.3 or greater\r\n \r\nTo run the downloaded GpxSplitter executable:\r\n - Oracle/Open Java Runtime 8 or greater\r\n\r\n### Building ###\r\n\r\nAfter cloning the github repository building the GpxSplitter source consists of\r\nmoving to the clone directory and running the Apache Maven goal \"install\".\r\nThe \"install\" goal will generate a \"target\" directory containing the GpxSplitter\r\nJAR file (`gpxsplitter-<version>.jar`).\r\n\r\n#### Commands ####\r\n\r\n 1. Clone the repository - `git clone <repository_path>`\r\n 2. Move to the cloned directory - `cd GpxSplitter`\r\n 3. Invoke maven install - `mvn install`\r\n 4. Move in the artefacts directory generated - `cd target`\r\n 5. Run the generated executable - `java -jar gpxsplitter-<version>.jar`\r\n\r\n### Running ###\r\n\r\nRunning GpxSplitter on any platform requires Java 8 or Open JDK.\r\n\r\n__Microsoft Windows__\r\n\r\n - Double-click the `gpxsplitter-<version>.jar` executable jar\r\n \r\nOr\r\n \r\n - Double-click the `gpxsplitter.exe` native executable\r\n\r\n__Mac OSX__\r\n\r\n - Double-click the `gpxsplitter-<version>.jar` executable jar\r\n\r\nOr\r\n\r\n - Download the DMG image (OSX verifies and opens GpxSplitter's directory)\r\n - Drag the App to your \"Applications\" folder and/or to your Dock\r\n - Run via Finder or clicking the icon on the dock\r\n\r\n__Linux__\r\n\r\n - Run the command `java -jar gpxsplitter-<version>.jar`\r\n\r\n## Software Builds ##\r\n\r\n### Master ###\r\n\r\nThe master branch of the GpxSplitter is a set of code in its most mature state.\r\n\r\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/AntoCuc/GpxSplitter.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/AntoCuc/GpxSplitter)\r\n\r\n__What does \"Build Passing\" mean:__\r\n\r\n - The code complies with Sun Microsystems' style checks (only exception is EOL)\r\n - At least 80% of the code's business logic is unit tested\r\n - A cross-platform executable JAR can be successfully generated\r\n - A Microsoft Windows executable can be successfully generated\r\n - An OSX DMG disk image and executable can be successfully generated\r\n\r\n## Updates ##\r\n\r\nIf no features are developed a monthly review of dependencies and plugins is \r\nperformed.\r\n\r\n## Issues ##\r\n\r\nHave you found a problem with GpxSplitter? \r\n[Please let us know](https://github.com/AntoCuc/GpxSplitter/issues).\r\nWe will fix it ASAP.\r\n\r\n## License ##\r\n\r\nThe GpxSplitter software is free and released under The MIT License. \r\nDetails below.\r\n\r\nThe MIT License \r\n\r\nCopyright 2011-2016 Antonino Cucchiara. \r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy \r\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal \r\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights \r\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell \r\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is \r\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions: \r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in \r\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software. \r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR \r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, \r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
